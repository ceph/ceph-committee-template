# Repository Template and Usage Guide

## Summary

This repository is designed to serve as a location to collaborate for all Ceph committees.

## Directory Naming Convention

To maintain a clear and organized naming system, directories should follow this convention:

{topic}-committee

For example:
* outreach-committee
* hardware-committee
* governance-committee

This naming convention helps identify the purpose and scope of the directory at a glance.

## Required Contents

Every committee directory must include the following files:

### 1. README.md

The README.md file serves as the directory’s introduction and documentation. It should include:

* The goal of the committee.
* The desired outcomes the committee aims to achieve.
* A list of members involved in the committee, including their roles (e.g., chair).

An example template can be found at the bottom of this README

### 2. LICENSE

The LICENSE.md file specifies the repository’s licensing terms. Apache 2.0 is recommended, and is used as a 
default for the committee directories. 

## Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)

While not mandatory, we encourage committees to define and commit to achievable OKRs. These OKRs should follow an 
annual cycle and be documented in a file named YYYY-OKRs.md. A template is provided below.

## Visibility

We encourage committees to keep their collaboration public. However there might be valid reasons for a repository
needing to be private, when in doubt please ask the board. A specific repository will be created for that purpouse.

## Issues and Github Projects

Committees are encouraged to leverage Github issues and projects to organize and track their work.
